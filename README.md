# Introduction
DocToWeb is an Office Word Add-in, which can convert a Word document to a responsive (PC/Mobile/Tablet) website with just one click.

Once I have tested many CMS, such as Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, etc. Yes, they are all excellent systems developed by smart team, but I still think they are too heavy and complicated.

Because for most people, what they have on their computer is just Office Word and they have few knowledge about server or server side language like PHP. At that moment, an idea came to me that why we canâ€™t just write our contents in Office Word and convert the Word document to a website with VBA.

With this in my mind, I developed DocToWeb and it did save me a lot of time and energy.
